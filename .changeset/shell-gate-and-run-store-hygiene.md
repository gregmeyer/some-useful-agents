**Security: community shell agent gate + run-store hygiene + auditing surfaces.** Closes `/cso` findings #5 (shell sandbox — short-term gate) and #7 (run-store hygiene). Third and final wave of the security remediation plan before v0.6.0's passphrase-based secrets KEK.

### Behavior changes

- **Community shell agents refuse to run by default.** `executeAgent` throws `UntrustedCommunityShellError` when an agent with `type: shell` and `source: community` reaches the executor without explicit opt-in. Opt in per-agent (not global) via the new `--allow-untrusted-shell <name>` flag on `sua agent run` and `sua schedule start`. The error message tells the user exactly how to proceed: audit the command, then re-run with the flag. The refusal is recorded in the run store as a failed run so it shows up in history.
- **Run-store is locked down.** `data/runs.db` is `chmod 0o600` at create time. A startup sweep deletes rows older than `runRetentionDays` (default 30; configure in `sua.config.json` or via the `retentionDays` option on `RunStore`). `Infinity` disables the sweep.
- **Opt-in secret redaction.** A new `redactSecrets: true` agent YAML field runs captured stdout/stderr through a known-prefix scrubber before the store records it. Targets AWS access key IDs (`AKIA…`), GitHub PATs (`ghp_…`), OpenAI / Anthropic keys (`sk-…` / `sk-ant-…` / `sk-proj-…`), and Slack tokens (`xoxb-`, `xoxp-`, `xapp-`). Intentionally narrow to avoid the false positives that kill generic "value > 20 chars" scrubbers.

### New CLI surfaces

- **`sua agent audit <name>`** — read-only. Prints the resolved YAML with type, source, schedule, `mcp:`, `redactSecrets:`, secrets, envAllowlist, env, dependsOn, and the full `command:` or `prompt:`. Community agents get a loud warning footer explaining the `--allow-untrusted-shell` gate.
- **`sua doctor --security`** — read-only. Checks chmod 0o600 on the MCP token, secrets store, and run-store DB; confirms the MCP bind host; lists community shell agents that would refuse to run; shows which agents are MCP-exposed. Non-zero exit when any check fails.

### API changes (for library consumers)

- `executeAgent(agent, env, options?)` — new third argument `{ allowUntrustedShell?: ReadonlySet<string> }`. Community shell throws `UntrustedCommunityShellError` when the agent name is not in the set.
- `LocalProvider` now accepts an options object as its third constructor arg: `{ allowUntrustedShell?, retentionDays? }`. The old two-arg form still works.
- `TemporalProvider` accepts the same two options and propagates `allowUntrustedShell` through the workflow input so workers inherit the submitter's trust decision.
- `RunStore` accepts a `{ retentionDays?: number }` options argument. Exposes `sweepExpired(days)` for manual invocation.
- New exports from `@some-useful-agents/core`: `UntrustedCommunityShellError`, `ExecutionOptions`, `LocalProviderOptions`, `RunStoreOptions`, `DEFAULT_RETENTION_DAYS`, `redactKnownSecrets`.
- New CLI helper: `createProvider(config, { providerOverride?, allowUntrustedShell? })`. The previous bare-string signature still works.

### Migration

If you write shell agents under `agents/community/`, they will now refuse to run unless the caller passes `--allow-untrusted-shell <name>`. Either move the agent to `agents/local/` (treated as trusted) or audit and opt in per-invocation. Run `sua doctor --security` to see which agents are affected.

If you want known-prefix redaction for an agent's output, add `redactSecrets: true` to its YAML. Default behavior is unchanged — existing agents keep storing output verbatim.

`data/runs.db` will now be chmod 0600 and the startup sweep will delete rows older than 30 days. To change the window, add `"runRetentionDays": N` to `sua.config.json`; set it very large to effectively disable.

Docs: `docs/SECURITY.md` and the README security notes are updated to reflect what shipped vs what remains on the roadmap.
