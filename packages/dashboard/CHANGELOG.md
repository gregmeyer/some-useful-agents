## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- dae7022: **Security: transport lockdown.** Closes findings #1, #3, #6, and #8 from the `/cso` audit. This is the first wave of security hardening that lands before the broader community-trial push. Three behavior changes worth noting up front, plus several invisible defenses.

  ### Behavior changes

  - **MCP server now binds to `127.0.0.1` by default.** Previously it bound to all interfaces (Node's default for `listen(port)` with no host), so anyone on the same Wi-Fi could POST to the MCP endpoint and execute any loaded agent with the user's secrets. The console log used to lie about this — it claimed `localhost` while binding everywhere. New `--host` flag on `sua mcp start` for users who genuinely need LAN exposure (prints a warning).
  - **MCP server now requires a bearer token** (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`). `sua init` and `sua mcp start` create a 32-byte token at `~/.sua/mcp-token` (mode 0600) on first run. Existing MCP clients (Claude Desktop, etc.) need to be updated with the new header — `sua mcp start` prints a ready-to-paste config snippet. Use `sua mcp rotate-token` to roll the token; `sua mcp token` prints the current value.
  - **Cron schedules now have a 60-second minimum interval.** node-cron silently accepted 6-field "with-seconds" expressions like `* * * * * *` (every second), which could melt an Anthropic bill. 5-field expressions (the standard) still pass unchanged. The new `allowHighFrequency: true` YAML field bypasses the cap with a loud warning logged on every fire.

  ### Invisible hardening

  - MCP server checks the `Host` header against a loopback allowlist (defense for the `--host` case).
  - MCP server checks the `Origin` header against the same allowlist (defends against DNS rebinding from a browser tab).
  - Each MCP session is pinned to the sha256 of the bearer token used to create it, so `rotate-token` cannot be abused to hijack live sessions.
  - Bearer comparison uses `crypto.timingSafeEqual` to avoid timing leaks.
  - `actions/checkout`, `actions/setup-node`, and `changesets/action` are now SHA-pinned in CI workflows so a compromise of those orgs can't silently ship malicious code through a moving tag. Dependabot opens weekly PRs to refresh the SHAs.
  - New `.github/CODEOWNERS` requires owner review for any change under `.github/workflows/` once the matching ruleset is enabled on `main`.

  ### Migration

  If you are using the MCP server today: after upgrading, run `sua mcp start` once to see the printed config snippet, paste the new `Authorization` header into your client config (Claude Desktop, etc.), and restart your client. If you have YAML agents with 6-field cron schedules, either move them to a 5-field schedule (recommended) or add `allowHighFrequency: true`.

### Minor Changes

- 89fd40d: Onboarding walkthrough and local cron scheduler.

  - `sua tutorial`: 5-stage interactive walkthrough that ends with a real scheduled dad-joke agent. Type `explain` at any stage for a Claude or Codex deep-dive.
  - `sua init`: now scaffolds `agents/local/hello.yaml` so `sua agent list` is never empty on first run.
  - `sua schedule start|list|validate`: cron-based scheduler via `node-cron`. Agents with a `schedule` field now actually fire.
  - `sua doctor`: new checks for scheduler readiness, installed LLM CLIs, and scheduled agent validity.
  - New core modules: `LocalScheduler` and `invokeLlm` / `detectLlms` utilities.
  - `dad-joke` example agent in `agents/examples/`.
  - Public `ROADMAP.md` at the repo root.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 3122f3f: Initial public release. Local-first agent playground with YAML agent definitions, CLI (`sua`), MCP server (HTTP/SSE), Temporal provider for durable execution, encrypted secrets store, and env filtering to prevent secret leakage to community agents.
