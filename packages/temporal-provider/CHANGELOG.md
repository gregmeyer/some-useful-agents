# @some-useful-agents/temporal-provider

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 3218194: **Security: chain trust propagation + MCP agent opt-in + threat model docs.** Closes `/cso` finding #4 and the MCP-scope portion of the remediation plan. Two behavior changes, one new default, and a new public doc.

  ### Behavior changes

  - **MCP agents must opt in to be callable.** Only agents with `mcp: true` in their YAML are exposed via the MCP server's `list-agents` and `run-agent` tools. Non-exposed agents respond as "not found" so a compromised client cannot enumerate your full catalog. Existing example YAMLs (`hello-shell`, `hello-claude`, `dad-joke`) ship with `mcp: true` so the tutorial keeps working; new agents scaffolded by `sua init` default to `mcp: false` with a commented hint.
  - **Community agent output flowing through chains is now treated as untrusted.**
    - Claude-code downstream prompts that consume `{{outputs.X.result}}` from a community-sourced X get a `[SECURITY NOTE]` prepended and the value wrapped in `BEGIN/END UNTRUSTED INPUT FROM X (source=community)` delimiters.
    - Shell downstream of a community upstream is **refused outright** with `UntrustedShellChainError`. This blocks the most direct RCE path (community output landing in a shell env var that a careless command could eval). Override via `executeChain`'s new `allowUntrustedShell: Set<agent-name>` option — per-agent, not global.
    - All chains, trusted or not, now receive `SUA_CHAIN_INPUT_TRUST=trusted|untrusted` in the downstream env so shell agents can branch.

  ### New documentation

  - **`docs/SECURITY.md`** — full threat model: intended use, trust rings, layered MCP defenses, chain trust propagation, env filtering, cron cap, supply-chain posture. Equally explicit about what sua does NOT defend against (shell sandbox, secrets-store encryption strength, run-output secrets, Temporal history, remote MCP, DoS) so operators can evaluate fit without reading the code.
  - **README** gains a four-sentence threat-model banner above the Quick start section, and the existing "Security notes" list is rewritten to reflect current reality.

  ### API changes (worth calling out for library consumers)

  - `ChainOutput` (new exported type) — the outputs map value is now `{ result, exitCode, source }`. The resolver uses `source` to decide whether to wrap.
  - `resolveTemplateTagged(template, outputs)` (new) — returns `{ text, upstreamSources: Set<AgentSource> }`.
  - `executeChain(agents, provider, triggeredBy, options)` — fourth argument is now an options object `{ allowUntrustedShell?, pollInterval? }`. The previous positional `pollInterval` signature is replaced. No internal callers exist so this is a clean break; adjust any direct consumers.
  - `UntrustedShellChainError` (new exported error) — thrown before the run starts.

  ### Migration

  If you author YAML agents: add `mcp: true` to any agent you want reachable from Claude Desktop or another MCP client. The CLI commands (`sua agent run`, `sua schedule start`, etc.) are unaffected.

  If you consume `@some-useful-agents/core` as a library: `executeChain`'s fourth arg became an options object, and the outputs map carries `source`. If you were passing a bare number for poll interval, wrap it as `{ pollInterval: n }`.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- dae7022: **Security: transport lockdown.** Closes findings #1, #3, #6, and #8 from the `/cso` audit. This is the first wave of security hardening that lands before the broader community-trial push. Three behavior changes worth noting up front, plus several invisible defenses.

  ### Behavior changes

  - **MCP server now binds to `127.0.0.1` by default.** Previously it bound to all interfaces (Node's default for `listen(port)` with no host), so anyone on the same Wi-Fi could POST to the MCP endpoint and execute any loaded agent with the user's secrets. The console log used to lie about this — it claimed `localhost` while binding everywhere. New `--host` flag on `sua mcp start` for users who genuinely need LAN exposure (prints a warning).
  - **MCP server now requires a bearer token** (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`). `sua init` and `sua mcp start` create a 32-byte token at `~/.sua/mcp-token` (mode 0600) on first run. Existing MCP clients (Claude Desktop, etc.) need to be updated with the new header — `sua mcp start` prints a ready-to-paste config snippet. Use `sua mcp rotate-token` to roll the token; `sua mcp token` prints the current value.
  - **Cron schedules now have a 60-second minimum interval.** node-cron silently accepted 6-field "with-seconds" expressions like `* * * * * *` (every second), which could melt an Anthropic bill. 5-field expressions (the standard) still pass unchanged. The new `allowHighFrequency: true` YAML field bypasses the cap with a loud warning logged on every fire.

  ### Invisible hardening

  - MCP server checks the `Host` header against a loopback allowlist (defense for the `--host` case).
  - MCP server checks the `Origin` header against the same allowlist (defends against DNS rebinding from a browser tab).
  - Each MCP session is pinned to the sha256 of the bearer token used to create it, so `rotate-token` cannot be abused to hijack live sessions.
  - Bearer comparison uses `crypto.timingSafeEqual` to avoid timing leaks.
  - `actions/checkout`, `actions/setup-node`, and `changesets/action` are now SHA-pinned in CI workflows so a compromise of those orgs can't silently ship malicious code through a moving tag. Dependabot opens weekly PRs to refresh the SHAs.
  - New `.github/CODEOWNERS` requires owner review for any change under `.github/workflows/` once the matching ruleset is enabled on `main`.

  ### Migration

  If you are using the MCP server today: after upgrading, run `sua mcp start` once to see the printed config snippet, paste the new `Authorization` header into your client config (Claude Desktop, etc.), and restart your client. If you have YAML agents with 6-field cron schedules, either move them to a 5-field schedule (recommended) or add `allowHighFrequency: true`.

### Minor Changes

- 89fd40d: Onboarding walkthrough and local cron scheduler.

  - `sua tutorial`: 5-stage interactive walkthrough that ends with a real scheduled dad-joke agent. Type `explain` at any stage for a Claude or Codex deep-dive.
  - `sua init`: now scaffolds `agents/local/hello.yaml` so `sua agent list` is never empty on first run.
  - `sua schedule start|list|validate`: cron-based scheduler via `node-cron`. Agents with a `schedule` field now actually fire.
  - `sua doctor`: new checks for scheduler readiness, installed LLM CLIs, and scheduled agent validity.
  - New core modules: `LocalScheduler` and `invokeLlm` / `detectLlms` utilities.
  - `dad-joke` example agent in `agents/examples/`.
  - Public `ROADMAP.md` at the repo root.
